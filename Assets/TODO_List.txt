Game name: Hordes of Zombor

Known BugList:
 - Buliding worker while TC at <25% health causes building to break (prevent them from building at this level)
 - TownCenter highlighted - it dies - I click elsewhere, error on deselect(unhighlight).

Game concepts:
 - Each round consists of starting out with a worker and TC, little resources. Wood, Food, Stone are all used for in-round upgrades and unit creation and doesnt carry over to next wave.
	- Late game unit like a caravan that could carry over some resources into the next wave (could cost gold).
	- Some neutral team that defends the gold mines from both player and enemy.
 - Gold can be found on the map that is used to upgrade everything with forever lasting upgrades.
 - Gold can only be spent on a late-game in-round building like a blacksmith.
 - Want shield warriors that can block arrows like spartans.
 - Units have an overall control of defend base, hold forward resources, all out charge enemy base.
 - Individual unit groups can be controlled with different types of formations like shield wall, spread out, box formation, etc...
 - Combat triangle for different types of units.
 - Each round will consist of a set range of enemy resources, starting unit types, and difficulty. But the difficulty will amp up indefinitely (Ladder gamemode that acts as a leaderboard)

 - Make trees NavObstacles, and if people can go through trees it will allow it
	- Have special units like mages taht could shrink people around him to allow them to run through trees.
	- Random modifies that make all units that the AI produces be 50% smaller so they can fight through trees.
 - Tutorial could have a map for this specific mechanic
 - Ladder mode could have a custom created maps (every 10 waves?) that utilizes some of these mechanics intentionally
 - Allow players (for certain modes) to customize how many trees/stones/bushes they would like generated, give them some range to play with. They must stay use the same amount of min% of total resources and max% of total resources.
 - Start menu should have a little game scene thats looking at my player with like a sword and sheild (or current equipment) looking out over a ridge and the camera pans over to a randomly generated world with some AI's battling w/ epic music.


 Different game concept:
 - Module based buildings that are a self contained room that can snap onto buildings, each block has its own health and uses.
	- Redstone-like mechanic that could allow for traps in these rooms
