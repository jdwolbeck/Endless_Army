Game concepts:
 - Each round consists of starting out with a worker and TC, little resources. Wood, Food, Stone are all used for in-round upgrades and unit creation and doesnt carry over to next wave.
	- Late game unit like a caravan that could carry over some resources into the next wave (could cost gold).
	- Some neutral team that defends the gold mines from both player and enemy.
 - Gold can be found on the map that is used to upgrade everything with forever lasting upgrades.
 - Gold can only be spent on a late-game in-round building like a blacksmith.
 - Want shield warriors that can block arrows like spartans.
 - Units have an overall control of defend base, hold forward resources, all out charge enemy base.
 - Individual unit groups can be controlled with different types of formations like shield wall, spread out, box formation, etc...
 - Combat triangle for different types of units.
 - Each round will consist of a set range of enemy resources, starting unit types, and difficulty. But the difficulty will amp up indefinitely (Ladder gamemode that acts as a leaderboard)
